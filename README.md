•	This is robust software made with Java, JavaFX and combination of Apache Server and MYSQL db 

•	In this System admin logins and then he can perform operations like adding employees whole detail, updating their salaries, along with it in Homepage there is statistical representation of total, active and inactive employees.

•	 There is also bar chart which give information about the count of employees added in the application as per days.
